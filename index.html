We do not need to see a bloody body to understand violence; the evidence is in the destroyed homes, the displaced families, and the despair in people's eyes. These images capture the "spatial conditions" that make life in Gaza impossible.

    <p><strong>About this project</strong><br>
      We hear the numbers every day, but they are rising so fast that it’s hard to grasp what they mean.
      It’s easy to see “67,000” and forget that every single digit stands for a person who had a life, a family, and a name.
    </p>
    <p>This website is an attempt to resist that numbness. It is designed to make you take your time.</p>
    <p>When you zoom all the way out, the victims are grouped into blocks of data, this is how we usually see the war, as “statistics.”
      But as you zoom in, those blocks break apart until every square represents a single human being.
    </p>
    <p>Please don’t just scroll past. Take time to look and reflect, read the names, and witness the reality behind the numbers.</p>
